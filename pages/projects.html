      <p>I lead a project team to create a website called The Green Trade that allows users to trade clothing with people nearby. The goal is to
        promote sustainable fashion and offer a no-cost alternative to buying new clothes. The website is still in progeses but
        the basic components are functioning! You are able to post items you want to trade, and view other items that are available. 
        This website is a React application set up using Google Firebase for the data collection, storage, and authentication, and utilizes 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and Bootstrap.js for additional styling! We also used Figma for desiging!</p>

        The learning goals of this project include Abstract Data Types in C++, Derived Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. 
        You’ll gain practice with C++-style Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and virtual functions.
        When you’re done, you’ll have a program that simulates a game of Euchre, supporting a AI player and a Human player.
